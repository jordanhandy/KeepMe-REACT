# KeepMe App (No Backend)
## Synopsis
The KeepMe app is a clone of Google Keep.  THis was a fun side project I completed, with the help of
the London App Brewery

## Components
This project consists of:
* A Frontend built with ReactJS

## To Use:
1. In the root directory, run "npm install".  This will install the server dependencies
2. "npm start" from the client directory should open the React frontend on Localhost 3000
    2. Check the console for specifics
3. Note: This does **not** have data persistence.  Data will disappear when the server is restated
